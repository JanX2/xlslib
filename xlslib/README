Please see this web site for updates, documentation, and for submitting
patches and bug reports.

Until we get the documentation sorted out, this archive contains
"xlslibRefGuide.pdf", a PHP guide that can be used as well for the 
C/C++ version.

== CREDITS ==
This code was originally developed at Yeico S.A. de C.V. by
Ruben D. Gonzalez and others. 0.2.5 and later developed by David Hoerl.


== OVERVIEW ==
xlslib permits programmatic creation of multi-sheet .xls files, which
are then directly openable by MS Excel. This capability is useful when
you need to save large data sets, perhaps with summary information, in
a form that is easily viewable by others. The .xls format is as of
Release 1.2 BIFF8. This format is documented in both the "Microsoft Excel97 
Developer's Kit" [currently out of print but used copies can be obtained 
on Amazon], and the OpenOffice.org's "Microsoft Excel File Format".

== CONTENTS ==
The suite contains the xlslib library, and a test application (easily
modifiable) that demonstrates various modes of creating spreadsheets.

There are three types of documentation: the source manual Manual.xls, 
which can be printed or just used for referece. Secondlu a pdf version
of this name xlslibRefGuide.pdf. Finally, refer to the main.cpp file in
the targets/test folder to see how to use the library. If you want to 
use this with a C app, then link in the library and include xlslib/xlslib.h.

The C interfaces are documented in that file. Essentially you create a worksheet,
then use that object as the first parameter of subsequent calls. When done, you
would then call the delete function. An example file is included in the test
folder: main.c There is also a test file that uses the "C" interface.

== NOTES ==
With the conversion to BIFF8 in Release 1.2, addition formatting capabilies become
available. Unfortunately, these are not listed in the existing pdf document
so to find them you will need to look at the xlslib.h header file.
