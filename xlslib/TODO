Code cleanup
------------

[GerH] currently the header file organization is a bit of a mess; the rename of config.h to xlsys.h 
       helps (it is a hack!) when using xlslib in a large project environment where lots of libraries/modules
       are -I included / used.
       
       The 'best' way would probably allow/enforce a single -I include/xlslib/ style '-I' arg, i.e. editing all
       #include<> statements in here to go from
       
       #include <xlslib.h>
       
       to
       
       # include <xlslib/common/xlslib.h>
       
       etc.etc. so we significantly reduce the risk of collisions among various libs' header filenames, due to
       sealous -I usage by the application.
       
       
       Meanwhile, the xlsys.h + xlconfig.h + xlstypes.h set is messy, IMHO. But I'm the one who turned it into a
       (bigger) mess; the current state of affairs is rather an intermediate stage, as now all types are defined in
       one place, so the next step here would be to reorganize those 3 header files and make sure they once again
       represent&contain what they should:
       
       - system autoconf-detected capabilities
       - system-dependent #includes, #defines, type emulations, etc. - all to make xlslib see a unified type system
       - xlslib basic types, which are portable - thanks to the first two items here.

General xlsLib Features to be added
------------------------
- Formulas (current author, in progress)
- ObjectiveC Framework for OS X (current author, in progress)
- Charts (original author)
- Particular interface features: (original author)
  + A command-line-like interface for defining all the options
    of an extended format (using a command string). The parameters and 
    options have to be defined (and a parser has to be implemented).

  + An OR-like interface for the border definition (colors, styles, etc.).
