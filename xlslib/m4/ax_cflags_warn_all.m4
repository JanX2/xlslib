# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AX_CFLAGS_WARN_ALL [(shellvar [,default, [A][, [NA]]])]
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   Try to find a compiler option that enables most reasonable
#   warnings. This macro is directly derived from VL_PROG_CC_WARNINGS
#   which is split up into two AX_CFLAGS_WARN_ALL and
#   AX_CFLAGS_WARN_ALL_ANSI
#
#   For the GNU CC compiler it will be -Wall (and -ansi -pedantic) The
#   result is added to the shellvar being CFLAGS by default.
#
#   Currently this macro knows about GCC, Solaris C compiler, Digital
#   Unix C compiler, C for AIX Compiler, HP-UX C compiler, IRIX C
#   compiler, NEC SX-5 (Super-UX 10) C compiler, and Cray J90 (Unicos
#   10.0.0.8) C compiler.
#
#    - $1 shell-variable-to-add-to : CFLAGS
#    - $2 add-value-if-not-found : nothing
#    - $3 action-if-found : add value to shellvariable
#    - $4 action-if-not-found : nothing

dnl  implementation tactics:
dnl   the for-argument contains a list of options. The first part of
dnl   these does only exist to detect the compiler - usually it is
dnl   a global option to enable -ansi or -extrawarnings. All other
dnl   compilers will fail about it. That was needed since a lot of
dnl   compilers will give false positives for some option-syntax
dnl   like -Woption or -Xoption as they think of it is a pass-through
dnl   to later compile stages or something. The "%" is used as a
dnl   delimimiter. A non-option comment can be given after "%%" marks
dnl   which will be shown but not added to the respective C/CXXFLAGS.
